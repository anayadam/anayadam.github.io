I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from Utrecht University. Previously, I obtained a M.Phil. in Economics (_cum laude_) and B.Sc. in Economics and Business Economics (_cum laude_) from Utrecht University. During my Ph.D., I was visiting researcher at the Development Innovation Lab at the University of Chicago.

My research interests are in development economics, specifically education and gender. My research focuses on understanding how household and individuals make decisions on high-stakes economic outcomes, such as education and marriage. And, how these decisions are shaped by and shape inequalities. I conduct randomised controlled trials in field-settings as well as lab experiments. My current projects are in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda.
